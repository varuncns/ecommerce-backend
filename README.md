## âœ… Milestone Breakdown

---

###  Milestone 1: Spring Boot + MySQL Integration

* Initialized Spring Boot project
* Created Git repo and pushed initial code
* Connected MySQL with Spring Data JPA
* Verified connection + basic structure

---

###  Milestone 2: JWT Authentication System

* `POST /auth/register` â†’ Register new users
* `POST /auth/login` â†’ Login and receive JWT
* Passwords hashed using BCrypt
* Stateless JWT token generation & validation
* Configured JWT filter and security chain

---

###  Milestone 3: Authenticated User Access

* Created secure `/user/profile` endpoint
* Built and configured `JwtAuthFilter`
* Authenticated users validated from token
* Unauthorized access returns 403 or 401
* RBAC separation between public and protected routes

---

###  Milestone 4: Admin APIs + Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Defined roles: `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`
* `/admin/dashboard` â†’ accessible only to admins
* `POST /auth/admin/register` â†’ programmatically register admins
* Role loaded from DB â†’ injected into JWT â†’ validated by Spring Security
* Regular users blocked from admin routes


---

### Milestone 5: Product Module (Create + Read)

* Introduced Product entity with fields: productCode, name, price, stock, etc.
* POST /admin/products â†’ Admins can create new products
* GET /products â†’ Public can view all products
* Enforced uniqueness using productCode
* Validated access control: only admins can create; public can read
* Added business logic layer to prevent duplicates
* All tests passed: secure, clean, and public-facing
